<H1>Objectives of AGENT</H1>
<P>
<B><I>The purpose of AGENT is to produce
an innovative map design software based on multi-agent technology.</I></B>
<P><P:first-letter>A</P:first-letter>GENT comes at a time of increasing 
understanding in map generalisation, together with sophisticated software 
techniques for implementation. An important industrial consequence is 
that the autonomous design and display of maps according to themes and 
scales specific to the users’ needs at multiple scales are within reach. 
</P><P>
More precisely, the project will achieve the definition and modelling of 
behaviours of "geographical agents and structures" in the context of 
generalisation. This includes&nbsp:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>mechanisms to select and to display agents,</LI>
<LI>mechanisms to validate agents’ actions, and</LI>
<LI>the definition of strategies and dynamics that resolve competition
among agents.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
In order to validate the methodological research, the project will focus
on two prototypes for the fully automated design of multi-scale thematic
representations: a professional tool and a public information desk.
